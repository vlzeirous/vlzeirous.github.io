Hello ma, happy 3rd anniversary! My school life has been hectic so sorry 
if I am butting heads with you na naman. I am just frustrated na parang 
wala lang effort ko in regards sa nangyayari sa health. Still, I love you
with all my heart. Sana magustuhan mo ito, mwah. Wishing for many many 
years na makakasama ka, thank you for being my guardian angel. Helping
me when I don't know what to do with college and engaging with me about
topics that we can both share an opinion on. May the remainder of our
year bring us more happiness and prosperity. Have a speedy recovery!
